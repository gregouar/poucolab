# Collaborative Scientific Data Platform â€“ Project Description

## Overview

This project is a collaborative, structured-data platform for scientific teams, especially those working in fields like paleontology, archaeology, and ecology. It enables researchers to collect, manage, and analyze specimen-based measurement datasets with a focus on traceability, offline usability, and eventual integration of rich media (e.g., 3D models).
